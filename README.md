# Hi, I'm Dr. Danisha L. Thomas 

## About Me

I'm a data scientist specializing in predictive analytics, healthcare systems, and behavioral intelligence. With 20+ years as a registered nurse in critical care and healthcare leadership, I bring a unique perspective to data science—one grounded in high-stakes decision-making, operational optimization, and evidence-based practice.

I hold a PhD in Clinical Psychology with forensic psychology experience, an MSN in Health Systems Leadership, and an MS in Crisis Management. My published dissertation on recidivism prediction has garnered 1000+ academic citations. I've spent my career synthesizing complex information under pressure, leading teams, and translating data into actionable insights—long before I had "data scientist" in my title.

Now, I'm combining that deep domain expertise with technical skills in Python, SQL, and machine learning to solve complex problems at the intersection of healthcare, behavioral research, and systems optimization.
